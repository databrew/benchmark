strategy_and_execution_vision_1,"There are diverse perspectives about what a digital bank means reflecting a lack of alignment and common vision about where the business needs to go. This often results in piecemeal initiatives or misguided efforts that lead to missed opportunities, sluggish performance and false starts of the digitak bank"
strategy_and_execution_vision_2,"Bank leaders may have a clear and common understanding
of exactly what digital means to them and, as a result, what it means to their business and articulated in any position document but it is somewhat theoretical and not translated into an actionable plan for implementation"
strategy_and_execution_vision_3,"Being digital is about using data to make better and faster decisions, devolving decision making to smaller teams, and developing much more iterative and rapid ways of doing things. 
Cross functional teams share the same rooms fostering creativity 
Thinking in a digital way is not limited to just a handful of functions. It incorporates a broad swath of how the bank operate, including creatively partnering with external companies to extend necessary capabilities. The bank's digital mind-set institutionalizes cross-functional collaboration, flattens hierarchies, and builds environments to encourage the generation of new ideas. Incentives and metrics are developed to support such decision-making agility.
                       The organizational culture is perceived as ""agile"": quick to mobilize, nimble, collaborative, easy to get things done, responsive, flow of information, quick decision making, empowered to act, resilient, learning from failures.
                       They are able to support the cultural shift."

- Customer engagement: migrating to direct digital channels; the bank is providing a seamless online and offline channel experience.
- Ecosystem network engagement: extending the network of business partners developping limited new digital affiliate partnerships
